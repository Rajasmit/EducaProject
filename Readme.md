# Building an E-learning Platform

<p>
By using model inheritance, I created a versatile system to manage different types of content for the course modules. I implemented a custom model field to order objects. I also used class-based views and mixins. I worked with groups and permissions to restrict access to my views. Finally, I used formsets to manage course modules, and I built a drag-and-drop functionality with jQuery UI to reorder modules and their contents.
